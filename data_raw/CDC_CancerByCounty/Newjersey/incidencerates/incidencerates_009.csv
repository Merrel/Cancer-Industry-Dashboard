State Cancer Registries may provide more current or more local data.
"† Incidence rates (cases per 100,000 population per year) are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population [http://www.seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html] (19 age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-9, ... , 80-84, 85+). Rates are for invasive cancer only (except for bladder cancer which is invasive and in situ) or unless otherwise specified. Rates calculated using SEER*Stat. Population counts for denominators are based on Census populations as modified [https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] by NCI. The 1969-2016 US Population Data File [https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] is used for SEER and NPCR incidence rates."
"‡ Incidence data come from different sources. Due to different years of data availability, most of the trends are AAPCs based on APCs but some are APCs calculated in SEER*Stat. Please refer to the source for each area for additional information."

Rates and trends are computed using different standards for malignancy. For more information see malignant.html.

"^ All Stages refers to any stage in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage [ https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/ssm/ ]."

"Interpret Rankings provides insight into interpreting cancer incidence statistics.  When the population size for a denominator is small, the rates may be unstable.  A rate is unstable when a small change in the numerator (e.g., only one or two additional cases) has a dramatic effect on the calculated rate."
