"Methodology: Cancer prevalence estimates are derived from state specific cancer mortality and survival data using a statistical package called MIAMOD (Mortality-Incidence Analysis MODEL). Cancer survival models are derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) [https://seer.cancer.gov/] Program data and adjusted to represent state specific survival."
"For more information on prevalence, please see the about this table web page [http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/help/about/prevalence.html]."
"Source: Single age and year state specific mortality data for cancer and all causes of death from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/], and respective populations from the US Census Bureau [http://www.census.gov/], are available for calendar years 1969-2007 from SEER*Stat. The population projections were obtained from the US Census Bureau [http://www.census.gov/]."
Note: The sum total of the individual states may not equal the total U.S. statistic due to rounding.
Prevalance data is not avaiable for Puerto Rico
