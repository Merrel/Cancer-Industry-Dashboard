"† Incidence rates (cases per 100,000 population per year) are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population [http://www.seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html] (19 age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-9, ... , 80-84, 85+). Rates are for invasive cancer only (except for bladder cancer which is invasive and in situ) or unless otherwise specified. Rates calculated using SEER*Stat. Population counts for denominators are based on Census populations as modified [https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] by NCI. The 1969-2016 US Population Data File [https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] is used for SEER and NPCR incidence rates."

Rates are computed using cancers classified as malignant based on ICD-O-3. For more information see malignant.html.

"^ Late Stage is defined as cases determined to be regional or distant. Coding is generally based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage [ https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/ssm/ ] but may include other staging variables if necessary."

"Health Service Areas are a single county or cluster of contiguous counties which are relatively self-contained with respect to hospital care. For more detailed information, please see the Health Service Area information page at http://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/hsa.php ."

"Please note that the data comes from different sources. Due to different years ( /historicaltrend/differences.html ) of data availablility, most of the trends are AAPCs based on APCs but some are APCs calculated in SEER*Stat. ( https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/ ) Please refer to the source for each graph for additional information. "

"Interpret Rankings provides insight into interpreting cancer incidence statistics.  When the population size for a denominator is small, the rates may be unstable.  A rate is unstable when a small change in the numerator (e.g., only one or two additional cases) has a dramatic effect on the calculated rate."

Data for United States does not include Puerto Rico.
