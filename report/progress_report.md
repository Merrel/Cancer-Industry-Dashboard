## Introduction

Cancer, in all of its various forms, is one of the leading causes if death world-wide.  Decades of work by medical researchers has led to great advances in treatment and comprehension of this disease. However, predicting cancer risk and identifying its causes remains an open and diverse challenge. 



There exists an ongoing tention between human industry and human health. As a species, we have spent much of the last 150 years pursuing grand industrial progress in nearly every industry. Advances in industries like manufacturing and agriculture have made us more productive, enabled new lifestyles, and saved many lives. However, the history of industrialization is riddled with tragic discoveries that new products or processes could wreak havoc on public health.



Despite government regulation and oversite, industrial activity continues to be a common link in the etiology of human cancer. The reality is that industrial byproducts of past and present industry are silent killers, active in towns all across the country. As recently as 2015, several towns in Georgia began to experience unusualy high rates of rare cancers. In Waycross, Georgia, there are ongoing investigations into whether byproducts from local rail-yards might be the cause [https://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/why-are-rare-cancers-killing-so-many-people-in-a-small-georgia-town/].



## Problem Definition

Spatial epidemiology s

## Survey

A great deal of work has been done to invsetigate single causes of cancers.  Perhaps most famously, Richard Doll's discovery of the connection between smoking and lung cancer [doll1956lung] has surely saved countless lives world wide.



## Proposed Method

Data Collection

- Cancer incidence data 
  - Collect from CDC : https://www.statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/quick-profiles/index.php?statename=georgia
- Industry 'bigness' factors -- Measures of how much of a given industry activity occurs in a given county
  - Collect from BEA
  - Overview of data type and heritage: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/county-business-patterns
  - Factors Available per county: # Establishments, # Employees, $ Total annual payro
- Industry Indicators
