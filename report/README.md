# CSE 6242 - Project Progress Report

*This file is a copy of [outline_progress_report.md](https://github.com/nazanin-tabatabaei/DataVisualAnalytics_Industries-cancer/blob/progress-report-text/report/outline_progress_report.md) to facilitate easy rendering in GitHub.*


## Introduction

- Describe cancer as universal issue with many contributing factors
- Describe connection between human industry and human cancer
- Mention that previous work has made progress in identifying specific high-risk factors (like smoking)
- But also mention that there are still many unknown source of cancer acros the county
  - Reference problems in Waycross, GA as example [https://www.atlantamagazine.com/great-reads/why-are-rare-cancers-killing-so-many-people-in-a-small-georgia-town/]



- Make a case that we need to do better by
  - Leveraging wdiely available data sets from industry, commerce, and cancer rates
  - Apply modern compute power to study many impacts at once, instead of one at a time
  - Leverage new techniques in machine learning etc...
  - Generate easy to understand graphics that make this really complicated topic actionable by elected leaders



## Problem Definition

- Define the problem in terms of 
  - Being highly multivariate -- lots of potential causes of cancer, lots of potential sources of those causes
  - Being BIG (Ben address total number of records)

## Survey

- Detail early history of Spatial epidemiology
- Detail highly focused efforts in cancer epideimology 
  - Smoking & Lung cancer, 
  - identifying the cause of cancer in one location; like Waycross, GA or Salem County, New Jersey
- â€‹	Modern Spatial Epidemilogy, GIS, etc... (papers in our lit review)



## Proposed Method

Top-level Summary

- Leveraging big data sets to do many-to-many analysis
  - i.e. we look at 
- Innovation:  I think its the broad ranging many to many analysis
  - Machine learning is also potientially innovative, buy I don't know how to address that



Data Collection

- Cancer incidence data 
  - Collect from CDC : https://www.statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/quick-profiles/index.php?statename=georgia
- Industry 'bigness' factors -- Measures of how much of a given industry activity occurs in a given county
  - Collect from BEA
  - Overview of data type and heritage: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/county-business-patterns
  - Factors Available per county: # Establishments, # Employees, $ Total annual payroll
- Industry Indicators
  - USEEIO Information
