# Survey

One of the oldest and most effective tools for determining the cause of disease is the study of its transmission in space and time. This field of study, commonly referred to as *Spatial Epidemiology* began to emerge in the mid-nineteenth century. Early pioneers such as Dr. John Snow [Snow 1855] demonstrated that by plotting the location and incidence of disease on a map, it was possible to discover its origin and possible means of transmission. This field was advanced by E.N. Pavlovsky and many others in the twentieth century [Pavlovsky 1966] through the use of improved mapping techniques and a greater understanding of disease vectors. Until the advent of the computer, practitioners of this field relied on manual collection of disease registries and hand-draw plots.

Over the last thirty years, dramatic expansions both compute and health data availability have enabled new techniques for the study of geographic disease risk factors. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) enable researchers to search for identify geographic coindicence of disease clusters with data ranging from land use to the locations of high-voltage power lines [Nuckols et al. 2005].

On the grounds that big data and data mining advancements stimulate the field of epidemiology, Bellinger et al. [Bellinger 2017] have explored alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. Spatial data mining and Geospatial artificial intelligence combine innovations in different areas to extract knowledge from spatial big data [VoPham 2018] . Common algorithms for location prediction are: Linear regression model, Bayesian classifiers, neural networks and decision trees. But as the nature of SDM is different, these algorithms are not fully able to solve the problems that require Spatial AutoRegressive (SAR) and Markov-hybrid models [Mishra 2018] based on Bayesian Classifier algorithms [Kumar 2015].

Cluster analysis has also been shown to be an accurate technique for studying disease incidence in small regions. Elliot [Elliott 2000] builds the structure behind this approach. An example of its use is a study that introduced a spatial epidemiology system that provides analytical capabilities via regression models and geographic distribution measurements as well as user-friendly data visualization through disease mapping and clustering. The usability of the system was confirmed correlating lung cancer mortality rates with median salary in Florida [Wang 2013]. Another study[Vieira 2005] looked into the link between residence and different types of cancer in Cape Cod, Massachusetts using the same clustering approach.
