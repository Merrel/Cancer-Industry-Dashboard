# Approach and Innovation

Data limitations, uncertainty in decision making and hard-to-use data visualizations have been highlighted as key components in spatial epidemiology[19]. A meta-study has pointedly[13] shown that much research has been reactionary to post-outbreak situations as opposed to prior, identifying/predicting health risks using key geospatial features. The reality is that these reactionary studies are expensive and often controversial. No locality wants to be labeled a 'cancer hotspot' due to the potential impact on residency and industry.

Understanding the local data, designing user-friendly software packages, access on geocoded data and nationwide tracking programs are considered as essential schemes for improving the current state[1]. Our novel approach will aggregate the relevant past datasets containing key features (as identified in referenced studies) and synthesize new datasets using the USEEIO input-output model[17] to provide the foundation for predictive analysis through machine learning algorithms for county-resolution patterns within the United States.

Specifically, we intend to analyze a broad range of industries and their outputs, along with a wide range of cancer types in a *many-to-many* analysis. Compared to the *many-to-one* approach more typically pursued in spatial epidemiology, we believe that our tool will rapidly identify a great many plausible correlations between industry output indicators and cancer rates. Every year new cancer hotspots are identified across the country. The broad ranging insight gained through our analysis will enable government planners to effectively allocate resources to detailed local studies and to find potential hotspots before more lives are lost.
